What trends do you notice?\nComparing the popularity of these four Christian names, we can conclude that Mary was the most popular. A peak of 53k was reached by this name in 1950. Out of these four names, Paul is the second most popular and was very well-known from 1950 to 1970. Paul reached about 25k in 1954. Compared to the other two names, Peter and Martha were not in the trends. But in 1956, there were about 10,000 people with the name Peter. In addition, Martha was named roughly 10,000 in 1947. In summary, after the 1950s, the names mentioned above saw a decline in popularity, and by 2000, they had fallen out of popularity.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Include and execute your code here\nnames_list = ['Mary', 'Martha', 'Peter', 'Paul']\nselected_names_data = df[df['name'].isin(names_list)]\nselected_names_data = selected_names_data[(selected_names_data['year'] &gt;= 1920) & (selected_names_data['year'] &lt;= 2000)]\nfig = px.line(selected_names_data, x='year', y='Total', color='name', title='Name Usage Comparison (1920 - 2000)')\nfig.show()",
