Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:\n100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather\n30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather.\nFrom April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%.\ntype your results and analysis here\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Include and execute your code here\n\n# Calculate the mean of 'Late Aircraft' excluding missing values\nmean_delay_late_aircraft = df[df['num_of_delays_late_aircraft'] != 'NaN']['num_of_delays_late_aircraft'].mean()\n\n# Replace missing values with the mean\ndf['num_of_delays_late_aircraft'] = df['num_of_delays_late_aircraft'].replace('NaN', mean_delay_late_aircraft)\n\ndf['severe'] = df['num_of_delays_weather']\ndf['mild_late'] = df['num_of_delays_late_aircraft'] * 0.3\ndf['mild_nas'] = np.where(df['month'].isin(['April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August']),\n                          df['num_of_delays_nas'] * 0.4,\n                          df['num_of_delays_nas'] * 0.65)\ndf['weather_total'] = df['severe'] + df['mild_late'] + df['mild_nas']\n\n# Check and convert data types before rounding\nnumeric_columns = ['severe', 'mild_late', 'mild_nas', 'weather_total']\ndf[numeric_columns] = df[numeric_columns].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')\n\n# Format and rounding only numeric columns\ndf[numeric_columns] = df[numeric_columns].apply(lambda x: round(x,2))\n\n# Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame with selected columns\nprint(df[numeric_columns].head())\n\n\n   severe  mild_late  mild_nas  weather_total\n0     448     -299.7   2988.70        3137.00\n1     233      278.4    607.75        1119.15\n2      61      317.4    581.75         960.15\n3     306      676.5   3519.75        4502.25\n4      56      204.0    414.70         674.70",
